Macro launches a UI element
Drop down to select a spell effect
  // https://github.com/Kekilla0/Personal-Macros/tree/master/00%20Core%20Macros/Dialog Can use this as a template/resource
  Ability to add/remove an effect from the UI element
    Should be able to edit from the menu also, though just removing and adding new may be easier to manage?
  Hooks insto Active effects to add the effect to the selected actor(s), if applicable.
    Mage armor should add the armor bonus etc
    // Can use https://github.com/Kekilla0/Personal-Macros/blob/master/00%20Core%20Macros/Active%20Effects/Toggle%20Effect.js as a template/reference
  In put the Initiative of the effect
    Potentially default to the current initiative of the selected actor
  Input the number of rounds of the effect
    Will need to determine if it's rounds or longer to setup the active effect properly
Once status is selected, output to chat card
